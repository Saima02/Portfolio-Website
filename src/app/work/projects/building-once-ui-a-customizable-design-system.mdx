## Overview

In this project, I focused on designing a sensor-based assistive system that detects obstacles within 20 cm using ultrasonic sensors and activates a buzzer and vibration alert to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely and independently.

## Key Features

- Obstacle Detection: Detects obstacles ahead using ultrasonic sensors.

- Vibration Alerts: Provides vibration feedback based on obstacle distance.

- Audible Alerts: Buzzer sound increases in intensity as the user approaches an obstacle.

## Technologies Used

- Hardware: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04), Buzzer, Vibration Motor, Battery Module

- Software: Arduino IDE (Embedded C / C++)

## Challenges and Learnings

Sensor Accuracy: Calibrating ultrasonic sensors for different obstacle distances.

Hardware Integration: Combining multiple components to work in sync.

## Outcome

Successfully developed a working prototype that detects obstacles and alerts the user through vibration and sound signals. The project demonstrates how simple sensor-based electronics can significantly improve the safety and independence of visually impaired individuals.
