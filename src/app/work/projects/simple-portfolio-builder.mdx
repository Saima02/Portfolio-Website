## Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application that allows users to search for any city and view its current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. It integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and dynamically display results.

## Key Features

- **Live Weather Data:** Fetches real-time weather information using OpenWeatherMap API.  
- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter any city name to get instant weather updates.  
- **Dynamic UI:** Weather details and icons update automatically based on user input.  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap (Geocoding & Forecast)  
- **Other:** Geolocation API for detecting userâ€™s current location

## Challenges and Learnings

- **API Integration:** Handling asynchronous JavaScript and parsing JSON data.  
- **UI Responsiveness:** Ensuring the layout remains consistent across devices.  
- **Error Handling:** Managing invalid city inputs and network errors gracefully.

## Outcome

Developed a fully functional and visually appealing weather dashboard that enhances user experience through live weather tracking. This project strengthened my understanding of API integration, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and responsive web design principles.
