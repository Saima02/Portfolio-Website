## Overview

This tutorial covers fundamental **SQL commands** used to query databases effectively.  
We will explore **DISTINCT, WHERE, LIKE, AND, OR, IN, and BETWEEN** with **practical examples** using the **DVD Rental database**.

---

## 1️⃣ DISTINCT

**Function:** Removes duplicate rows from the result set.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
````

**Practice Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM film;
```

> Returns a list of **unique genres** from the `film` table.

---

## 2️⃣ WHERE

**Function:** Filters rows based on a condition.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Practice Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE city = 'London';
```

> Retrieves customers who live in London.

---

## 3️⃣ LIKE

**Function:** Performs **pattern matching** in text columns.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```

**Practice Query:**

```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE 'A%';
```

> Finds all films whose title starts with the letter 'A'.

---

## 4️⃣ AND / OR

**Function:** Combine multiple conditions for flexible filtering.

**Syntax Examples:**

```sql
-- AND
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE city = 'London' AND active = 1;

-- OR
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE city = 'London' OR city = 'Paris';
```

> `AND` ensures **both conditions** are true, `OR` allows **either condition**.

---

## 5️⃣ IN

**Function:** Checks if a value matches **any value in a list**.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

**Practice Query:**

```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('PG', 'PG-13');
```

> Returns films with a rating of `PG` or `PG-13`.

---

## 6️⃣ BETWEEN

**Function:** Filters rows within a **range of values**.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

**Practice Query:**

```sql
SELECT rental_date
FROM rental
WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2005-12-31';
```

> Returns rentals made between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2005.
